After inputting the incorrect code, we were able to analyze which parts of it are going to give the correct ouput
and which ones will not. The R script tool allows us to easily view the codes and input each one individually,
until we are ready to "run" them. The R script analyzes each code and automatically inputs an error warning
in the case of a code which is incorrect. In the case of a data file that is thousands of lines long, the R script
would allow for it to be easily detectable as to which code is incorrect and where the error is exactly. 
It would be beneficial to "check" if the codes are giving the correct outputs by sorting through the data and 
examining whether a small portion is correct in terms of the larger scale.
